# Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction
This is a Medical Insurance Cost Predictive System, whihc the accuracy of the prediction is as high as 90%.  
This project developed a machine learning system using Python and its libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn to predict individual medical insurance costs. By loading and processing the dataset, we conducted an in-depth analysis, including data exploration, visualization of feature distribution, and descriptive statistics. We then encoded the categorical features to fit the model's requirements. Using Scikit-learn's LinearRegression, we trained and evaluated the model, where the data was split into training and testing sets to verify the model's accuracy. Ultimately, we established a predictive system capable of estimating individual medical insurance costs based on personal feature information, such as age, gender, and BMI.
